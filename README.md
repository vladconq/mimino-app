# Mimino App
Learning Georgian is easy!

Mimino is an application for learning the Georgian language. My application:
- will introduce you to all the letters of the Georgian alphabet
- offers to learn sets of words on popular topics
- allows you to gain knowledge in two trainings at once: quiz and flashcards
- tracks the best record and motivates to achieve more
- offers training sessions with a random order of questions for better study of the material
- allows you to listen to pronunciation from Georgian speakers

The development and design were developed by me. It is absolutely free, so the code is also available in open access :)
